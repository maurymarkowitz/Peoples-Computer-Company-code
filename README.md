BASIC programs from the People's Computer Company
=================================================

This folder contains the programs found in the PCC magazines. Only complete programs are included, short example code and snippets, like those in the Programmer's Toolbox columns, are not included. Most of the programs that appeared in PCC, especially in earlier editions, were either in the HP 2100 dialect or DEC BASIC from the EduSystem 20. These can be run using [RetroBASIC](https://github.com/maurymarkowitz/RetroBASIC). There is also one SNOBOL program and two in PILOT.

The programs are copied as close to their original format as possible, including odd whitespace and the use of square brackets in arrays. There are some things that will look like whitespace typos, but these are in the original code. The print quality of the magazine was highly variable, which may have introduced subtle bugs. This is further confused by the printer font which used a bar across the O instead of 0 as is common today, which then switched in later editions, and 1's that look like both L and I.

The programs are organized into subfolders named for the volume and issue they appeared in. The issue list below is modified from one made by Bob Albrecht, The Dragon himself. The original list contained only the games, this has been expanded with any other non-game programs. PCC would often split articles across one or more issues, often describing the game in one issue and then providing the listing in another, or vice versa. Those articles that only *described* the games and do not include source code have been removed from the following list. The original list can be found at [The PCC Games List Project](http://www.svipx.com/pcc/gameslist.html).
