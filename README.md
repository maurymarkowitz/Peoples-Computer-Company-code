BASIC programs from the People's Computer Company
=================================================

This folder contains the programs found in the People's Computer Company magazines. Only complete programs are included, short example code and snippets, like those in the Programmer's Toolbox columns, are not included.

Most of the programs that appeared in PCC, especially in earlier editions, were in the HP 2100 dialect. These can be run using [RetroBASIC](https://github.com/maurymarkowitz/RetroBASIC). There are a small number in various DEC dialects, mostly BASIC-8, which also run in RetroBASIC. A small number are for the Datapoint 2200, which is so non-standard that nothing will run it. There is also one SNOBOL program and two in PILOT. The few assembly programs have not been included.

The programs are copied as close to their original format as possible, including odd whitespace and the use of square brackets for arrays. There are some things that will look like whitespace typos, but these are in the original code. The print quality of the magazine was highly variable, which may have introduced subtle bugs. This is further confused by the printer font which used a bar across the O instead of 0 as is common today, which then switched that after a couple of issues. There are 1's that look like both L and I, and many issues related to the low quality printing of the newsletter itself.

The programs are organized into subfolders named for the volume and issue they appeared in. The issue list below is modified from one made by Bob Albrecht, The Dragon himself. The original list contained only the games, this has been expanded with non-game programs as well. PCC would often split articles across one or more issues, describing the game in one issue and then providing the listing in another, or vice versa. Those articles that only *described* the games and do not include source code have been removed from the following list. The original list can be found at [The PCC Games List Project](http://www.svipx.com/pcc/gameslist.html).
